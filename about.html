                Thank you very much for visiting the all-in-one Minecraft
                quick start guide! I hope you have enjoyed the site and have learned
                something new about surviving your first night in Minecraft!
            </p>

                This website is a capstone project commemorating my IMPROVEMENT in
                front-end baiscs (HTML & CSS) after completing FIVE modules of a
                fullstack coding bootcamp!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in any of my other web-projects or would like to see
                me improve as I document my progression through capstone projects,
                I would encourage you to visit my Github profile!
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope to see you on my next project!
            </p>
