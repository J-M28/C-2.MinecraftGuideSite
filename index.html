                    <h2>What is Minecraft?</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that is focused on manipulating
                    different blocks. These blocks are representative of real-life
                    elements (well, if you exclude physics) such as dirt, stone,
                    oak wood, etc. Build and shape the world to your choosing,
                    where your imagination is the only limit!

                </header>
                <p>
                    Generating a world is as simple as clicking singleplayer on the main menu
                    (when you have initially opened up the application). There are many different
                    gamemodes as well as specific details that you can tweak about the world,
                    however, for the purposes of this tutorial selecting survival and leaving the
                    default settings will suffice. <br>
                    <em>
                        For the purposes of this guide, the tutorial will be done in a single-player world.
                        Version 1.19 at the time of writing this guide.

                    <h2>Surviving the First Night</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Surviving the first night can be a daunting and overwhelming task since night quickly
                    approaches and means certain death. The following is a simple list of tasks that
                    should be accomplished on the first night to ensure a successful and productive first day!
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather wood</li>
                    <p>
                        Every Minecraft adventure starts the same, you begin by punching wood (yes punching...),
                        there is no need to worry about the tree falling over as the wood blocks will float!
                        Gather about 10 - 15 logs of any kind that are nearby!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HOLD down the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON when facing a wooden block to begin "mining" the block. It will
                        drop the item and you can move you character ('W' for forward movement, 'A' for leftward movement,
                        'D' for rightward movement, and 'S' for downward movement). These movement controls will stay the
                        same and the way you mine blocks will stay the same for any block, so it is important you understand
                        and remember these basic controls!
                    </p>
                    <li>Craft crafting table and a wooden pickaxe</li>
                    <p>
                        You will need to craft a crafting table if you want to craft more advanced items beyond
                        the crafting table itself and a few wood items. Open your inventory (by default the 'E' key)
                        then place ONE of the wooden logs in the one of the crafting grids, there you will acquire 4
                        wooden planks
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Take your wooden planks and fill the crafting grid completely, congratulations you have crafted
                        the crafting table! To use any blocks, drag the items by left clicking them and placing them
                        on your hotbar (the row of slots at the bottom of the inventory seperated from the main grid)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Crafting items require that you arrange the ingredients in a shape resembling the final product.
                        Click the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON to interact (when facing an interactive block) or to place down
                        blocks. In this case, place down the crafting table, then face the crafting table and interact with it.
                        Begin by placing TWO wood PLANKS atop of eachother to craft sticks. Then place the sticks
                        and additional wooden planks in the shape of a 'T'. It looks similar to a pickaxe!
                    </p>
                    <li>Craft stone tools and a furnace</li>
                    <p>
                        The next step of progression is to look for an open cave OR simply dig down with anything until
                        you reach stone blocks. Then take out that trusty wooden pickaxe you crafted and begin mining the
                        stone blocks. Aim for roughly 20 - 30 cobblestone blocks!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you have collected an adequate amount of cobblestone blocks, head back up to the surface and
                        follow the recipes shown to craft a set of stone tools! After you should have a stone sword, stone
                        pickaxe, stone shovel, and stone axe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Take 8 cobblestone blocks and form a "donut" in the crafting grid to create a furnace, the crafting
                        table and the furnace are the two foundational blocks to progressing in the game!
                    </p>
                    <li>Forage for food by finding animals</li>
                    <p>
                        You will need a source of food! Look for any animals nearby and hunt them with your stone sword, they
                        will drop food items and may drop additional blocks (for example, chickens will drop feathers and sheep
                        will drop wool, etc)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will need to also cook this food to get the most out of your food products. Interact with your furnace
                        (right click on the furnace after first placing it down somewhere), place the food item on the topmost slot
                        and a source of fuel (either a wood plank, log or coal), your food will begin cooking! Once complete eat and
                        until you have either depleted your food source or your hunger bar is filled
                    </p>
                    <li>Find sheep and gather wool</li>
                    <p>
                        The night presents many dangerous creatures that want to hurt you! It is a good idea to skip the night! Begin
                        looking for sheep and hunting them down, you will need THREE wool blocks, if night is fast approaching you
                        can immediately skip to the next step and reattempt this task the next minecraft day!
                    </p>
                    <li>Craft a bed and create a home</li>
                    <p>
                        If you have enough wool blocks, follow the recipe below to craft your bed! Place it down somewhere, this will
                        be where you respawn whenever you health bar reaches zero.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Find any "wall" in the world (could be the side of a mountain), if none are nearby simply dig with your shovel for
                        dirt blocks. Immediately create a box by either digging it out the wall of a mountain or placing dirt blocks down
                        and building a dirt box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leave a two block vertical gap, this will be where you place your door. Follow the crafting recipe below to create a
                        door block and placing it down to fill the hole.
                    </p>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Congratulations! You have successfully survived your first night! To find out more information on what to do next,
