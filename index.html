                </header>
                <p>
                    Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that is focused on manipulating
                    different blocks. These blocks are representative of real-life
                    elements (if you exclude physics) such as dirt, stone,
                    oak wood, etc. Build and shape the world wherever your imagination
                    leads you.

                    Generate a world by clicking 'singleplayer' on the main menu. There are
                    many options to tweak your world. For this tutorial, select survival
                    and use the default settings.

                </header>
                <p>
                    Suriviving the first night can be overwhelming with so much to do and night quickly
                    approaching. Follow the simple to-do list below to get started on a successful
                    first day!
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <div class="first-night-instruction">
                        <li>Gather wood</li>
                        <p>
                            Every Minecraft adventure starts the same, you begin by punching wood (yes punching...),
                            there is no need to worry about the tree falling over as the wood blocks will float!
                            Gather about 10 - 15 logs of any kind that are nearby!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HOLD down the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON when facing a wooden block to begin "mining" the block. It will
                            drop the item and you can move you character ('W' for forward movement, 'A' for leftward movement,
                            'D' for rightward movement, and 'S' for backward movement). These movement and mining
                            controls will stay the same throughout the game, so it is important you understand
                            and remember these basic controls!
                        </p>

                        <li>Craft the crafting table and a wooden pickaxe</li>
                        <p>
                            You will need to craft a crafting table if you want to craft more advanced items beyond
                            the crafting table itself and a few wood items. Open your inventory (by default the 'E' key)
                            then place AT LEAST one wood log in a crafting grid (click the item
                            with the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON and drag to the crafting grid). You can then craft 4 wood planks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Take your wooden planks and fill the crafting grid completely. Congratulations you have crafted
                            the crafting table!
                        </p>

                        <img alt="Placing the crafting table on the hotbar" src="images/hotbar.png">
                        <p>
                            To use a block, drop the block onto your hotbar (the row of slots at the bottom of the
                            inventory seperated from the main grid). Close your inventory (by default the 'E' key).
                            Depending on the context, if you highlight over the item in your hotbar and click the
                            RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON you will place the block down. If you are facing an INTERACTIVE block
                            (like a chest, crafting table, or furnace) you will interact with the block instead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Crafting items require that you arrange the ingredients in a shape resembling the final product.
                            Place down the crafting table, then face the crafting table and interact with it.
                            Begin by placing TWO wood PLANKS atop of eachother to craft sticks. Then place the sticks
                            and additional wooden planks in the shape of a 'T'. It looks similar to a pickaxe!
                        </p>

                        <li>Craft stone tools and a furnace</li>
                        <p>
                            Look for an open cave OR simply dig down with anything until you reach stone blocks.
                            Take out that trusty wooden pickaxe you crafted and begin mining the
                            stone blocks. Aim for roughly 20 - 30 cobblestone blocks!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once you have collected enough cobblestone blocks, head back up to the surface and
                            follow the recipes shown to craft a set of stone tools! After you should have a stone sword, stone
                            pickaxe, stone shovel, and stone axe.
                        </p>

                            Take 8 cobblestone blocks and form a "donut" in the crafting grid to create a furnace, the crafting
                            table and the furnace are the two foundational blocks to progressing in the game!
                        </p>

                        <li>Hunt for food</li>
                        <p>
                            You will need a source of food! Look for any animals nearby and hunt them with your stone sword, they
                            will drop food items and may drop additional blocks (for example, chickens will drop feathers and sheep
                            will drop wool, etc)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You will need to also cook this food to get the most out them. Interact with your furnace
                            and place the food item on the topmost slot and a source of fuel (either a wood plank, log or coal)
                            on the bottommost slot. Your food will begin cooking, once fully cooked add the item into your hotbar
                            and eat it holding the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.

                            The night presents many dangerous creatures that want to hurt you! It is a good idea to skip the night! Begin
                            looking for sheep and hunting them down, you will need THREE wool blocks, if it is almost night you
                            can immediately skip to the next step and reattempt this task the next minecraft day!

                            If you have enough wool blocks, follow the recipe below to craft your bed! Place it down somewhere, this will
                            be where you respawn whenever you health bar reaches zero (remember to interact with it to set it as your spawnpoint).

                            Immediately create a box by either digging it out the wall of a mountain or shoveling dirt and building the box.

                            Leave a two block vertical gap, this will be where you place your door. Follow the crafting recipe below to create a
                            door block and place it down to fill the gap.
