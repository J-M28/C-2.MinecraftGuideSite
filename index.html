                <p>
                    Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that is focused on manipulating
                    different blocks. These blocks are representative of real-life
                    elements (if you exclude physics) such as dirt, stone,
                    oak wood, etc. Build and shape the world wherever your imagination
                    leads you.

                                there is no need to worry about the tree falling over as the wood blocks will float!
                                Gather about 10 - 15 logs of any kind that are nearby!

                                "mine" the block. The item will drop and when you are near it you will pick it up.

                                You will need to craft a crafting table if you want to craft more advanced items.

                                Press the 'E' key to open your inventory, press the LMB to place at least one wood log in a crafting
                                grid. As you can see, the wood log can be used to craft 4 wooden planks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Take your wooden planks and fill the crafting grid completely. Congratulations you have crafted
                                the crafting table!

                                To use blocks, you must drop them into your hotbar (the row of slots at the bottom of your
                                inventory seperated from the main grid). Depending on the context the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON (RMB)
                                will either place the block, consume the block OR interact with the block directly facing you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Crafting items involves arranging the ingredients in a shape resembling the final product.
                                Use the crafting table and place TWO wood planks atop of eachother to craft sticks.
                                Then place TWO sticks and THREE wooden planks in the shape of a 'T' as shown. It looks
                                similar to a pickaxe!

                                Look for an open cave OR simply dig down until you reach grey stone blocks.
                                Take out that trusty wooden pickaxe you crafted and begin mining the
                                stone blocks. Aim for roughly 20 - 30 cobblestone blocks!

                                Once you have collected enough cobblestone, head back to the surface and
                                follow the recipes shown to craft a set of stone tools! After you should have a stone sword, stone
                                pickaxe, stone shovel, and stone axe.

                                at the bottommost slot. Your food will begin cooking. Add the food item onto your hotbar to eat

                                The night presents many dangerous creatures that want to hurt you! It is a good idea to skip the night. Begin
                                looking for sheep and hunting them down, you will need THREE wool blocks. If it is almost night you
                                can immediately skip to the next step and reattempt this task the next minecraft day!

                                If you have enough wool blocks, follow the recipe shown to craft your bed! Place it down somewhere, this will
                                be where you respawn whenever you health bar reaches zero (remember to interact with it to set it as your spawnpoint).

                                Leave a two block vertical gap, this will be where you place your door. Follow the crafting recipe shown to create a
                                door block and place it down to fill the gap.
